Also latest online LwIP documentation can be found here https://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_1_x/index.html.

The documents that are useful apart from documents related to microcontroller are also added in this repository.

Only Raw APIs for UDP and TCP are explored right now. I will keep updating documents and links as I do it further.
